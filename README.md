# Responsive Landing Page

This is a simple responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS.

## 🚀 What We Did

- Created index.html and style.css files.
- Designed a clean layout with:
  - A header containing logo and navigation links.
  - A fullscreen hero section with a heading, paragraph, and a call-to-action button.
  - A footer with social media icons.
- Used *Flexbox* for layout and *media queries* for responsiveness.
- Made the hero section cover the *entire screen* without scrollbars.
- Connected the project to a *GitHub repository* and pushed the code.

## 🌐 How to View

Open index.html in your browser or use Live Server in VS Code to view the project.

Let me know if you want to add *screenshots* or a *GitHub Pages live link*.
